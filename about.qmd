### About Me

As a young professional early in my career, I understand there is still much to learn - and I am fully committed to that journey. With a strong academic foundation in finance and current postgraduate study in Business Analytics at Monash University, I am working hard every day to develop both my technical and professional skills. I have gained valuable hands-on experience in finance, insurance, and data analysis, and I am eager to keep improving through real-world challenges. I may be at the beginning, but I bring energy, adaptability, and a serious willingness to grow into every opportunity.
