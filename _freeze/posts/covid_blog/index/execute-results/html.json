These systems relied on long quarantine periods, frequent testing, and strong infection control to keep imported cases contained. However, the emergence of the Delta variant in 2021 challenged this success. Delta’s higher transmissibility and lower vaccine efficacy raised a crucial question: \n\n> *Can vaccination alone keep quarantine systems safe when the virus becomes more transmissible?* \n\nZachreson et al. (2022) addressed this question by modelling how vaccination and viral transmissibility interact to shape the effectiveness of quarantine systems in low-tolerance settings.\n\n### Analysis\n\nZachreson et al. (2022) combined two types of models to assess quarantine performance. The first was an individual-based simulation of a border quarantine facility following World Health Organization guidelines, including a fourteen-day stay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on days 3 and 12, and isolation for positive cases and their close contacts. The second was a branching-process model that used the simulated breach events to estimate the probability of community outbreaks. By connecting these models, the authors evaluated how changes in vaccine efficacy and virus transmissibility affect the likelihood that a traveller or worker would trigger an epidemic once outside quarantine.\n\nThe analysis explored a wide range of basic reproduction numbers (R₀ = 3 to 10) and vaccine efficacies (0 to 90 percent). Each scenario assumed full vaccination among travellers and quarantine workers but varied vaccination coverage in the general population. Results showed that when Delta-like conditions applied, with R₀ around 6, vaccines needed at least sixty percent efficacy to maintain the same breach risk observed before Delta. For R₀ values of 8, the required efficacy increased to roughly seventy percent. Even under ideal conditions, quarantine systems could not offset the risk posed by a poorly vaccinated population; once a breach occurred, outbreaks spread rapidly unless community coverage was high.\n\nThe authors also ran sensitivity analyses to test how biological and operational factors might change outcomes. Shorter incubation periods—such as the roughly 4.4 days estimated for Delta—made quarantine more effective because infected individuals were detected earlier and had shorter infectious periods. The model also distinguished between vaccine efficacy against becoming infected and against onward transmission from breakthrough cases. When vaccines reduced both infection and transmission, the required efficacy for safety fell by about 20 percent. However, if infection control measures within quarantine weakened, the risk of breach events could increase by up to two orders of magnitude. @fig-outbreak below illustrates how the time until there is a 50 percent probability of an outbreak (t₅₀) grows rapidly as both vaccine efficacy and community coverage increase.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relationship between vaccine coverage, efficacy, and time until a 50 percent probability of an outbreak (t₅₀).](index_files/figure-html/fig-outbreak-1.png){#fig-outbreak width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThese findings emphasise that vaccination substantially reduces the probability and frequency of quarantine breaches, but its success depends on both the level of efficacy against transmission and how many people in the community are vaccinated. In essence, quarantine works best when supported by widespread community immunity and strict infection control among staff and travellers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe study by Zachreson et al. (2022) demonstrates that vaccination alone cannot guarantee the safety of border quarantine systems when facing highly transmissible variants such as Delta. Although vaccines remain powerful tools for preventing severe disease, their reduced ability to block transmission means that quarantine policies must remain strict even for vaccinated travellers. Effective infection control, daily staff testing, and strong public-health measures remain critical components of outbreak prevention.\n\nFor policymakers, the key message is that border quarantine and mass vaccination must operate together rather than in isolation. When vaccine coverage is high and infection control measures are maintained, quarantine breach risks decline sharply, extending the time between potential outbreaks from a matter of weeks to several months. However, if either component falters, the risk of community spread rises quickly. In summary, vaccination helps to contain risk, but quarantine still matters—and together they form the strongest defence against emerging variants.\n\n### Reference\n\nZachreson, C., Shearer, F.
